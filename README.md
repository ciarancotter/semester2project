# Summary
- Welcome to team 2's software developement project.

- this game is still in the developement phase

- the game will be an experimental game that includes an endless world in which the player moves through rooms by jumping onto platforms. The user will be able to move the player using their physical movements which will be detected by an Xbox kinect. They will interact with the characters that are in the game through the use of GPT-3 generated text. Some of the art in the game will be automatically generated through the DALL-E API.

## Setting 
- The Player is an Archaeology student, currently working on their thesis in Boole library into the night.
- The Boole library closes, and the player gets locked in.
- The player starts panicking, not knowing what to do. They end up bored and give up hope, knowing well that there is no way out.
- They have the whole library to themselves, and start exploring. They find the infamous UCC boole basement Egyptian mummy sarcophagus. 
- They decide that this is where they will sleep for the night.
- After a long nights sleep, they wake up in Ancient Egypt, in 4200 BC, Luxor.
- Stranded in a pyramid, they think of nothing other than the thesis. This is a perfect opportunity for them to have the best thesis known to man. The adventure begins.

## project style
- We will use [googles python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for our project. This will be enforced using the [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lint and the [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) formatter. These will run automatically on our Github on pushes and pull requests to enforce the style guide.
- we will automatically generate documentation using the [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) tool.
